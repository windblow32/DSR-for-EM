### Technical Report on “Description-Similarity Rules: Towards Flexible Feature Engineering for Entity Matching”

We provide detailed proof for all propositions. Besides, we supplement all similarity functions used in DSR and explain how these similarities are related to our *descriptions*.

We would like to clarify that the code and intellectual property rights of this paper are owned by Huawei Cloud Computing Technologies Co., Ltd copyright, and it is strictly prohibited to be made public. Therefore, we cannot submit them as supplemental material for reproducibility. Nevertheless, **we have made every effort to make the method reproducible as follows:** 

1. For code implementation, we give **the pseudo-code of each algorithm and supplement a line-by-line explanation.**

2. For parameters, we have given **the default settings of key parameters** for each dataset. Besides, we have presented **a cold-start version of DSR:** adding a priori parameter search by Bayesian Optimization. At the same time, we have shown that **there is no statistical difference in the F1 score between our cold-start version and DSR.**

3. For the implementation of all similarity functions and other details of our proposition, **we supplement them in our technical report.**

We hope that our efforts meet the requirements for reproducibility. If any additional information is needed, **we are proactive in updating our technical report in the future.**
